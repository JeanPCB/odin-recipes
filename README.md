# Odin Recipes üç≥
A recipes website to cook my coding skills in HTML, Git and Github

## About
*This project is part of my web development journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).*  

I created **multiple recipes pages** and linked them together using **HTML basics**, turning a simple idea into a small functional website.  

## What I Learned / Skills Practiced  
- **HTML5**  - Building page structure, adding ordered/unordered lists, links, images and more.  
- **Git**    - Starting version control from scratch and keeping track of it as the project grew.    
- **Github** - Creating a repository, pushing local changes and keeping project online.  

## Features
- Multiple recipes pages connected throug clickable links
- Clear and structured layout for each recipe
- Follow same "development pattern" through all project

## Why This Project?
This project helped me solidify the fundamentals of web development, get hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, and build something visually enjoyable... even if it‚Äôs just virtual cooking for now.
