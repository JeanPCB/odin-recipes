# odin-recipes
A recipe website to train my HTML, Git and Github knowledge

## Introduction
This project is part of my web development learning with The Odin Project.  
It focuses on building **multiple recipe pages** linked with each others using **HTML basics**.  

Skills put in practice:
✅ HTML5 -> basic structure of a page, ordered/unordered lists, links and images  
✅ Git -> starting version control from project beginning and keeping track of it   
✅ Github -> setting a new repository and pushing local changes to Github.
