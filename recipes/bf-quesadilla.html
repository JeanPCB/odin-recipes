   <p>This quesadilla has scrambled eggs with bacon and melted cheese inside crispy fried tortillas for an easy pleasing breakfast or brunch.</p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>3 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>
      <li>2 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon butter, softened, or to taste</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>Â½ cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
   </ul>


   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Crack eggs into a small bowl. Add crumbled bacon and whisk until well combined.</li>
      <li>Spray a large skillet with cooking spray; warm over medium-high heat. Pour egg mixture into the skillet; cook and stir until eggs are set, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
      <li>Lightly butter one side of each tortilla. Warm a separate, dry skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
      <li>Place one tortilla into the warm skillet with the buttered side facing down. Spoon 1/2 of the scrambled egg mixture over one half of the tortilla.</li>
      <li> Sprinkle 1/4 cup Colby-Jack cheese over the egg mixture and fold the tortilla over top. Cook, turning as needed, until tortilla is toasted and crispy and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat to make second quesadilla.</li>
